Hi this is qorg11

I\'m a Void GNU/Linux user and I use Emacs as text editor, Perl C and
Lisp as programming languages. I make all kind of (probably
experimental) software

I like:

-   Emacs (So much that this document is written in org-mode (github
    thinks its md though)
-   Lisp
-   C
-   Perl
-   GNU/Linux and BSD

I dislike:

-   Systemd
-   JavaScript
-   border-radius

Working on: <https://github.com/qorg11/lainsafe>
<https://github.com/qorg11/k9core>

I don't like using github most of my software is in
<https://git.qorg11.net> so please use something like
`git-send-email(1)` for sending patches
