* Hi this is qorg11

My websites: <https://qorg11.net> <https://kill-9.xyz> <https://qorg.kill-9.xyz>

I'm a Void GNU/Linux user and I use Emacs as text editor, Perl C and Lisp as programming
languages. I make all kind of (probably experimental) software

I like:
- Emacs (So much that this document is written in org-mode (github thinks its md though)
- Lisp 
- C 
- Perl
- GNU/Linux and BSD

I dislike:

- Systemd
- JavaScript
- border-radius
Working on: <https://github.com/qorg11/lainsafe> <https://github.com/qorg11/k9core>

Thanks for reading
